# Vault Innovation Front-end Development Interview Test

Thanks for applying at Vault!

The tests in this exercise shouldn't take more than a couple hours or so to complete.

### Instructions

To get started, fork the repository and make a feature branch for your answers. Once you're done, create a pull request with your answers.

You will need to run a webserver using PHP with the `public` directory as the root. 

For example, if you're on osx, you could [install PHP with homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php#installation) and run: 

```
sudo php -S localhost:80 -t public
```

1) Use npm to install all the dependencies utilized in gulpfile.js. Please update all dependencies as you see fit. 

2) Make the responsive menu icon work using [CSS Hamburgers](https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers/)

3) Using Bootstrap, Sass, jQuery, and Handlebars, please create a responsive grid of cat images provided by [the cat api](http://thecatapi.com/).

4) Please utilize the provided file structure, and place all custom Sass and Javascript in the appropriate `resources/assets/` folder.

5) Try your best to make the site look polished. Feel free to use new fonts, animated effects, etc. It's very important that all these cats are presentable. 

6) [Make it perfect!](https://youtu.be/pUS_sjVaRjU?list=PLF7131A7CA221DC02&t=76)
